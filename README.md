The following repository contains 3 machine learning models, the first two(Decision Tree and K Nearest neighbour are used to predict if a patient has Breast Cancer based on the Dataset given (Breast Cancer Dataset), we used scikit learn and pandas for the data analysis part of the project



The other model which is an Artficial Neural Network is used to predict the price of a house based on the DataSet given (HousingPriceData),We used Keras,Tensorflow,Scikit learn and Pandas for this project
